The Food Images Eugene (FoodIE) stimuli set is a collection of images designed to elicit food cravings. The stimuli set includes 15 categories of foods, each rated only by individuals reporting cravings for that category of food.

The food categories each contain 60-70 appetizing images and include: barbeque, burgers, candy, cheese, chips, chocolate, cookies, doughnuts, French fries, fruit, fruit desserts, pasta, pizza, and roasted vegetables.

This repository contains code and ratings for the stimuli set.
